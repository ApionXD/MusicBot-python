#CIS4930: Advanced Programming with Python
##Assignment: Project

###Name: Discord Music Bot
###Team: Mason Bell, Adekunle Gbadamosi, Kyle Iarrobino
###GitHub Repo: https://github.com/ApionXD/MusicBot-python

###About: Our project is a Discord Bot with a variety of commands revolving around playing music. 
The way our bot is able to play music is by using a library called youtube-dl. This library allows for
the downloading of Youtube audio in the form of .mp3, from which we can then have our bot play on the desired 
voice channel. To separate our bot form others we also decided to implement a variety of other features including
a voting system, permissions, and serialization, along with a multitude of commands to make the user experience enjoyable. 

###Required Dependencies:
    - os
    - json
    - youtube_dl
    - discord.py    
    - asyncio
